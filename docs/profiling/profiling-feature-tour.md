# Overview of the profiling tools (C#, Visual Basic, C++, F#)

Application performance measuring tools are essential for developers who want to optimize their code and improve application performance. Visual Studio offers a range of profiling and diagnostics tools that can help you diagnose memory and CPU usage and other application-level issues. With these tools, you can accumulate performance data while you run your application. A profiler can help you make informed decisions quickly by providing a visual depiction of execution times and CPU usage for your application. In this article, we give a quick look at the most common profiling tools.

For help with choosing the correct tool, or to see profiling tool support for different app types, see [Which tool should I use?](../profiling/choose-performance-tool.md) For a tutorial that shows a general approach to optimizing code using the profiling tools, see [Case study: Beginner's guide to optimizing code](../profiling/optimize-code-using-profiling-tools.md).

For the best experience with this documentation, choose your preferred development language or runtime from the list at the top of the article.

## <a name="post_mortem"></a> Measure performance in release builds

Tools in the Performance Profiler are intended to provide analysis for **Release** builds. In the Performance Profiler, you can collect diagnostic info while the app is running, and then examine the collected information after the app is stopped (a post-mortem analysis).

Open the Performance Profiler by choosing **Debug** > **Performance Profiler** (or **Alt + F2**).

To see profiling tool support for different app types, see [Which tool should I use?](../profiling/choose-performance-tool.md).

In some scenarios, the window allows you to select [multiple profiling tools](../profiling/use-multiple-profiler-tools-simultaneously.md). Tools such as CPU Usage may provide complementary data that you can use to help in your analysis. You can also use the [command-line profiler](../profiling/profile-apps-from-command-line.md) to enable scenarios involving multiple profiling tools.

## Measure performance while debugging

The profiling tools that you can access during a debugging session are available in the Diagnostic Tools window. The Diagnostic Tools window appears automatically unless you have turned it off. To bring up the window, click **Debug / Windows / Show Diagnostic Tools** (or press **Ctrl** + **Alt** + **F2**). With the window open, you can select tools for which you want to collect data.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Diagnostic Tools window](../profiling/media/vs-2022/prof-tour-diagnostic-tools.png "Diagnostic Tools")

While you are debugging, you can use the **Diagnostic Tools** window to analyze CPU, memory usage, .NET counters, and you can view events that show performance-related information.

The **Diagnostic Tools** window is a common way to profile apps, but for Release builds you can also do a post-mortem analysis of your app instead. For more information on different approaches, see [Run profiling tools on release or debug builds](../profiling/running-profiling-tools-with-or-without-the-debugger.md). To see profiling tool support for different app types, see [Which tool should I use?](../profiling/choose-performance-tool.md).

Tools available in the Diagnostic Tools window or during a debugging session include:

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 8 and later is required to run profiling tools with the debugger (**Diagnostic Tools** window).

## Analyze CPU usage

The CPU Usage tool is a good place to start analyzing your app's performance. It will tell you more about CPU resources that your app is consuming. You can use the [debugger-integrated CPU Usage tool](../profiling/beginners-guide-to-performance-profiling.md) or the [post-mortem CPU Usage tool](../profiling/cpu-usage.md).

When using the debugger-integrated CPU Usage tool, open the Diagnostics Tool window (if it's closed, choose **Debug / Windows / Show Diagnostic Tools**). While debugging, open the  **Summary** view, and select **Record CPU Profile**.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Enable CPU usage in the Diagnostic Tools](../profiling/media/vs-2022/prof-tour-enable-cpu-profiling.png "Diagnostic Tools Enable CPU Usage")
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
![Enable CPU usage in the Diagnostic Tools](../profiling/media/prof-tour-enable-cpu-profiling.png "Diagnostic Tools Enable CPU Usage")
::: moniker-end

One way to use the tool is to set two breakpoints in your code, one at the beginning and one at the end of the function or the region of code you want to analyze. Examine the profiling data when you are paused at the second breakpoint.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
The **CPU Usage** view shows you a list of functions ordered by longest running, with the longest running function at the top under **Top Functions**. The **Hot Path** section shows you the call stack for the functions that are using the most CPU. These lists can help guide you to functions where performance bottlenecks are happening.

![Diagnostic Tools CPU Usage view](../profiling/media/vs-2022/prof-tour-cpu-usage.png "Diagnostic Tools CPU Usage")
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"

The **CPU Usage** view shows you a list of functions ordered by longest running, with the longest running function at the top. This can help guide you to functions where performance bottlenecks are happening.

![Diagnostic Tools CPU Usage view](../profiling/media/prof-tour-cpu-usage.png "Diagnostic Tools CPU Usage")
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
Click on a function that you are interested in, and you will see a more detailed **Call tree** view, with the selected function highlighted. The table shows columns with data such as the time spent in the function, including called functions (**Total CPU**), and a second column that shows the time spent in a function, excluding called functions (**Self CPU**). This data can help you evaluate whether the function itself is a performance bottleneck.

> [!TIP]
> The Visual Studio profiler supports both collecting and viewing traces. The profiler can also view traces that have been collected previously by other tools, such as dotnet-trace. Dotnet-trace produces sampling results, not an instrumented trace. For more information, see [dotnet-trace](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-trace).

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
Click on a function that you are interested in, and you will see a more detailed three-pane "butterfly" view, with the selected function in the middle of the window, the calling function on the left, and called functions on the right. The **Function Body** section shows the total amount of time (and the percentage of time) spent in the function body excluding time spent in calling and called functions. This data can help you evaluate whether the function itself is a performance bottleneck.

![Diagnostic Tools caller callee "butterfly" view](../profiling/media/prof-tour-cpu-usage-caller-callee.png "Diagnostic Tools Caller Callee View")
::: moniker-end

## Analyze memory usage

The **Diagnostic Tools** window also allows you to evaluate memory usage in your app using the **Memory Usage** tool. For example, you can look at the number and size of objects on the heap. You can use the [debugger-integrated Memory Usage tool](../profiling/memory-usage.md) or the [post-mortem Memory Usage tool](../profiling/memory-usage-without-debugging2.md) in the Performance Profiler.

.NET developers may choose between either the [.NET Object Allocation tool](../profiling/dotnet-alloc-tool.md) or the [Memory usage](../profiling/memory-usage.md) tool.

- The **.NET Object Allocation** tool helps you identify allocation patterns and anomalies in your .NET code, and helps identify common issues with garbage collection. This tool runs only as a post-mortem tool. You can run this tool on local or remote machines.
- The **Memory usage** tool is helpful in identifying memory leaks, which are not typically common in .NET apps. If you need to use debugger features while checking memory, such as stepping through code, the [debugger-integrated Memory usage](../profiling/beginners-guide-to-performance-profiling.md) tool is recommended.

To analyze memory usage with the **Memory Usage** tool, you need to take at least one memory snapshot. Often, the best way to analyze memory is to take two snapshots; the first right before a suspected memory issue, and the second snapshot right after a suspected memory issue occurs. Then you can view a diff of the two snapshots and see exactly what changed. The following illustration shows taking a snapshot with the debugger-integrated tool.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Take a snapshot in the Diagnostic Tools](../profiling/media/vs-2022/prof-tour-take-snapshot.png "Diagnostic Tools Take Snapshots")
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
![Take a snapshot in the Diagnostic Tools](../profiling/media/prof-tour-take-snapshots.gif "Diagnostic Tools Take Snapshots")
::: moniker-end

When you select one of the arrow links, you are given a differential view of the heap (a red up arrow ![Memory Usage Increase](../profiling/media/prof-tour-mem-usage-up-arrow.png "Memory Usage Increase") shows an increasing object count (left) or an increasing heap size (right)). If you click the right link, you get a differential heap view ordered by objects that increased the most in heap size. This can help you pinpoint memory problems. For example, in the illustration below, the bytes used by `ClassHandlersStore` objects increased by 3,492 bytes in the second snapshot.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Diagnostic Tools heap diff view](../profiling/media/vs-2022/prof-tour-mem-usage-diff-heap.png "Diagnostic Tools Heap Diff view")
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
![Diagnostic Tools heap diff view](../profiling/media/prof-tour-mem-usage-diff-heap.png "Diagnostic Tools Heap Diff view")
::: moniker-end

If you click the link on the left instead in the **Memory Usage** view, the heap view is organized by object count; the objects of a particular type that increased the most in number are shown at the top (sorted by **Count Diff** column).

## Instrumentation

The Instrumentation tool is similar to the CPU Usage tool, except that it provides exact call counts and wall clock time instead of CPU utilization. The instrumentation method requires more overhead than the CPU Usage tool. This tool is available in the Performance Profiler. Open the Performance Profiler by choosing **Debug** > **Performance Profiler** (or **Alt + F2**). For more information, see [Instrumentation](../profiling/instrumentation-overview.md).

::: moniker range=">= vs-2022"

![Screenshot showing .NET Instrumentation data.](./media/vs-2022/instrumentation-data.png "Instrumentation data")
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= vs-2022"

## Examine File I/O

The [File I/O tool](../profiling/use-file-io.md) helps you understand how you can optimize your File I/O operations to improve performance in your apps. If you’re trying to investigate and diagnose slow loading times, the new File IO tool can help you understand how the I/O operations impact your spent time. This tool is available in the Performance Profiler. Open the Performance Profiler by choosing Debug > Performance Profiler (or Alt + F2).

The tool shows file read and file write operations in a tabbed list view.

![Screenshot showing File IO tool stopped.](./media/vs-2022/file-io-after.png "File IO tool stopped")

::: moniker-end

## Examine performance using PerfTips

Often, the easiest way to view performance information is to use [PerfTips](../profiling/perftips.md). Using PerfTips, you can view performance information while interacting with your code. You can check information such as the duration of the event (measured from when the debugger was last paused, or when the app started). For example, if you step through code (F10, F11), PerfTips show you the app runtime duration from the previous step operation to the current step.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Screenshot of PerfTips.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/prof-tour-perf-tips.png "Profiling Tour PerfTips")
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
![Screenshot of PerfTips.](../profiling/media/prof-tour-perf-tips.png "Profiling Tour PerfTips")
::: moniker-end

You can use PerfTips to examine how long it takes for a code block to execute, or how long it takes for a single function to complete.

PerfTips show the same events that also show up in the **Events** view of the Diagnostic Tools. In the **Events** view, you can view different events that occur while you are debugging, such as the setting of a breakpoint or a code stepping operation.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Screenshot of Diagnostic Tools Events view.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/prof-tour-events.png "Diagnostic Tools View Events")
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
![Screenshot of Diagnostic Tools Events view.](../profiling/media/prof-tour-events.png "Diagnostic Tools View Events")
::: moniker-end

 > [!NOTE]
 > If you have Visual Studio Enterprise, you can also see [IntelliTrace events](../debugger/intellitrace.md) in this tab.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-dotnet"
::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
## Analyze asynchronous code (.NET)

The [.NET Async tool](../profiling/analyze-async.md) allows you to analyze the performance of asynchronous code in your application. This tool is available in the Performance Profiler. Open the Performance Profiler by choosing **Debug** > **Performance Profiler** (or **Alt + F2**).

The tool shows each async operation in a list view. You can see information such as the start time, end time, and total time for an async operation.

![.NET Async Tool Stopped](../profiling/media/vs-2022/prof-tour-async-tool.png ".NET Async Tool Stopped")

This tool is supported for For .NET Core and .NET 5+ apps.
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="vs-2019"
## Analyze asynchronous code (.NET)

The [.NET Async tool](../profiling/analyze-async.md) allows you to analyze the performance of asynchronous code in your application. This tool is available in the Performance Profiler. Open the Performance Profiler by choosing **Debug** > **Performance Profiler** (or **Alt + F2**).

The tool shows each async operation in a list view. You can see information such as the start time, end time, and total time for an async operation.

![.NET Async Tool Stopped](../profiling/media/async-tool-opened.png ".NET Async Tool Stopped")

This tool is supported for For .NET Core and .NET 5+ apps.
::: moniker-end

## Analyze database performance (.NET)

For .NET Core and .NET 5+ apps that use ADO.NET or Entity Framework Core, the [Database tool](../profiling/analyze-database.md) allows you to record the database queries that your application makes during a diagnostic session. You can then analyze information about individual queries in order to find places where your app's performance can be improved. This tool is available in the Performance Profiler. Open the Performance Profiler by choosing **Debug** > **Performance Profiler** (or **Alt + F2**).

The tool shows each query in a list view. You can see information such as the query start time and duration.

![Allocation](./media/db-gotosource.png "Allocation")

## Visualize .NET counters (.NET)

Starting in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7, you can use the [.NET Counters tool](../profiling/dotnet-counters-tool.md) in Visual Studio to visualize performance counters. You can visualize counters created using [dotnet counters](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-counters). dotnet counters supports many counters such as CPU usage and garbage collector heap size.

The tool shows live values for each counter in a list view.

:::image type="content" source="../profiling/media/dotnet-counters-tool-collecting.png" alt-text=".NET Counter tool collecting.":::

This tool is supported for For .NET Core and .NET 5+ apps.
::: zone-end

## Examine application events

The generic [events viewer](../profiling/events-viewer.md) allows you to view the activity of your application through a list of events, such as module load, thread start, and system configurations, to help better diagnose how your application is performing right within the Visual Studio profiler. This tool is available in the Performance Profiler. Open the Performance Profiler by choosing **Debug** > **Performance Profiler** (or **Alt + F2**).

The tool shows each event in a list view. Columns provide information about each event, such as the event name, timestamp, and process ID.

![Event Viewer Trace](../profiling/media/prof-tour-events-viewer.png "Event Viewer Trace")

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
## View custom events in the timeline graphs

You can programatically create custom events that appear as icons in the timeline graphs such as the CPU utilization and memory usage timeline graphs. For more information, see [Add user marks to timeline](../profiling/add-timeline-graph-user-marks.md).
::: moniker-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-dotnet,programming-language-dotnetf"
## Analyze resource consumption (XAML)

In XAML apps, such as Windows desktop WPF apps and UWP apps, you can analyze resource consumption using the Application Timeline tool. For example, you can analyze the time spent by your application preparing UI frames (layout and render), servicing network and disk requests, and in scenarios like application startup, page load, and Window resize. To use the tool, choose **Application Timeline** in the Performance Profiler, and then choose **Start**. In your app, go through the scenario with a suspected resource consumption issue, and then choose **Stop collection** to generate the report.

Low framerates in the **Visual throughput** graph may correspond to visual problems that you see when running your app. Similarly, high numbers in the **UI thread utilization** graph may also correspond to UI responsiveness issues. In the report, you can select a time period with a suspected performance issue, and then examine the detailed UI thread activities in the Timeline details view (lower pane).

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="vs-2019"
![Application Timeline profiling tool](../profiling/media/prof-tour-application-timeline.gif "Profiling Tour Application Timeline")
::: moniker-end

In the Timeline details view, you can find information such as the type of activity (or the UI element involved) along with the duration of the activity. For example, in the illustration, a **Layout** event for a Grid control takes 57.53 ms.

For more information, see [Application Timeline](../profiling/application-timeline.md).
## Examine UI performance and accessibility events (UWP)

In your UWP apps, you can enable **UI Analysis** in the **Diagnostic Tools** window. The tool searches for common performance or accessibility issues and displays them in the **Events** view while you are debugging. The event descriptions provide information that can help resolve issues.

## Profile on WSL, Docker, and Linux

The profiling tools support profiling scenarios for WSL, Docker, and Linux. The tools supported on Linux and WSL are listed in [Which tools are supported on Linux?](../profiling/choose-performance-tool.md#which-tools-are-supported-on-linux)

- For WSL, make sure you've installed the prerequisites described in [Debug .NET Apps in WSL with Visual Studio](../debugger/debug-dotnet-core-in-wsl-2.md). Open the Performance Profiler (**Alt + F2**) and select WSL as the target.

  ![Screenshot of selecting WSL.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/prof-tour-selecting-windows-subsystem-linux.png)

- For Docker and Linux, make sure you're enabled for debugging and can run the app from Visual Studio before starting the profiler. For more information, see the article that best matches your scenario: [Debug apps in a local Docker container](../containers/edit-and-refresh.md), [Debug .NET Core on Linux using SSH by attaching to a process](../debugger/remote-debugging-dotnet-core-linux-with-ssh.md#prerequisites), or [Attach to a process running on a Docker container](../debugger/attach-to-process-running-in-docker-container.md).

  Next, you can attach to a running process in the Performance Profiler (**Alt + F2**) to collect profiling data.

  ![Screenshot of selecting a running process.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/prof-tour-attach-to-running-process.png)
::: moniker-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-cpp"
## Analyze GPU Usage (Direct3D)

In Direct3D apps (Direct3D components must be in C++), you can examine activity on the GPU and analyze performance issues. For more information, see [GPU Usage](./gpu-usage.md). To use the tool, choose **GPU Usage** in the Performance Profiler, and then choose **Start**. In your app, go through the scenario that you're interested in profiling, and then choose **Stop collection** to generate a report.

When you select a time period in the graphs and choose **view details**, a detailed view appears in the lower pane. In the detailed view, you can examine how much activity is happening on each CPU and GPU. Select events in the lowest pane to get popups in the timeline. For example, select the **Present** event to view **Present** call popups. (The light gray vertical VSync lines can be used as a reference to understand whether certain **Present** calls missed VSync. There must be one **Present** call between every two VSyncs in order for the app to steadily hit 60 FPS.)

You can also use the graphs to determine whether there are CPU bound or GPU bound performance bottlenecks.
::: zone-end

## Analyze performance (legacy tools)

In Visual Studio 2019,  the legacy Performance Explorer and related profiling tools such as the Performance Wizard were folded into the Performance Profiler, which you can open using **Debug** > **Performance Profiler**. In the Performance Profiler, the available diagnostics tools depend on the target chosen and the current, open startup project. The CPU Usage tool provides the sampling capability previously supported in the Performance Wizard. The Instrumentation tool provides the instrumented profiling capability (for precise call counts and durations) that was in the Performance Wizard. Additional memory tools also appear in the Performance Profiler.
