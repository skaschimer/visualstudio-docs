# Manage Copilot usage and models

GitHub Copilot includes built-in tools to help you track usage, manage your plan, and understand how model selection affects [request consumption](https://docs.github.com/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests).

## View Copilot usage

To track your Copilot usage:

1. Select the **Copilot badge** in the top-right corner of Visual Studio.
1. Select **Copilot Consumptions** from the menu to view the dialog.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-usage-models/copilot-consumptions-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Copilot Consumptions panel." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-usage-models/copilot-consumptions-panel.png":::

   Here, you can view your usage and the number of remaining requests. You can also select **Get more requests** to manage your Copilot plan on *GitHub*.

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub manages billing and subscriptions. For details, visit your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/billing/summary).

## Understand model selection

Copilot supports multiple AI models, and each model may consume requests at different rates based on assigned [multipliers](https://docs.github.com/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests#model-multipliers).

To view or change your current model:

1.	Open the **Copilot Chat** window.
1.	Use the **model picker** dropdown above the input field to select a model.

When your [premium request quota](https://docs.github.com/copilot/about-github-copilot/plans-for-github-copilot#comparing-copilot-plans) is exhausted, Copilot automatically falls back to a base model so you can continue working without interruption.

To manage model usage in non-chat interactions, configure the setting **Enhance non-chat requests with premium models** in **GitHub** > **Copilot** > **Editor**.

> [!TIP]
> Visit your [Copilot settings on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/copilot/features) to explore model options and subscription details.
