# Use GitHub Copilot for free in Visual Studio

GitHub Copilot Free enables you to experience AI-powered coding assistance in your IDE by providing limited access to select Copilot features. With [Copilot Free](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/github-copilot-free-is-here-in-visual-studio/), you can now access all AI-integrated features in Visual Studio, including [Completions](visual-studio-github-copilot-extension.md), Edits, and [Chat](visual-studio-github-copilot-chat.md).

+ Visual Studio 2022 [version 17.8](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-history) or later

## Copilot Free usage limits in Visual Studio

Copilot Free provides a limited number of code completions and chat responses for free per month. When you reach your monthly usage limit for chat or code completions or both, you'll get a notification and notice a change in Copilot functionality.

You can check your free tier status anytime by selecting **Copilot Free Status** from the Copilot badge dropdown in the top-right corner of the IDE.

You can also check the current status of your Copilot Free account on the [GitHub account settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot).

### Usage limit reached

When you hit the usage limits, your Copilot experience in Visual Studio may be impacted as follows:
