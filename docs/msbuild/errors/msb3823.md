## Description

There's a difference in how nonstring resources are serialized and deserialized between .NET Framework and .NET Core. In .NET Framework applications, resources are both deserialized and then preserialized, which isn't efficient, but was meant to handle diverse serialization and deserialization techniques. In .NET Core, the extra steps are avoided. However, you can also opt in to preserialization for .NET Framework projects, by setting the property mentioned in the error message.

## Resolution

If you want to use preserialized resources in a .NET Framework project, you must add a reference to the [System.Resources.Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Resources.Extensions) NuGet package, and also set the property `GenerateResourceUsePreserializedResources` to true.
