## Description

This error is a generic error that you get when MSBuild is unable to provide a more specific error about the exact problem that occurred when trying to generate a manifest.

## Resolution

Try running with verbose diagnostics (`-v:diag` on the MSBuild command line), and check everything related to signing the assembly, and the ClickOnce manifest generation. In Visual Studio, go to Project Properties (press **Alt**+**Enter**), and check the **Strong naming** settings under the **Build** section. Verify the correctness of any information provided, such as the key file. On Windows, type **certmgr.msc** in the search section of the taskbar to open the certificate management console. Check any relevant certificates in the certificate store on the machine.

You can also generate a binary log using the `-bl` option, and use the [MSBuild Structured Log Viewer](https://msbuildlog.com) to get more details about what was happening in the build process before the error occurred.
