## Description

This error occurs when a project file contains a project of a type that can't be built by MSBuild. Most modern project types support MSBuild, but some older project types in Visual Studio, and project types supported in Visual Studio extensions, do not.

This issue only occurs when you build from the MSBuild or `dotnet` command line; the solution should still build in Visual Studio, if the required workloads, components, and extensions are installed.

## Resolution

If your solution contains project types that don't support MSBuild, use `devenv /build` to build the solution on the command line. See [/Build (devenv.exe)](../../ide/reference/build-devenv-exe.md).
