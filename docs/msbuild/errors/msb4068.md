## Description

This error occurs when MSBuild is given an XML file to build, but the file isn't a project file. Specifically, MSBuild looks for the top-level `Project` XML element to see if it can process the input file as a valid project file, and if it doesn't find it, you get this error. The error text gives the name of whatever top-level element that was found.

## Resolution

Check the file that was provided. Note that the file MSBuild tries to build might be found automatically. For example, if you invoke MSBuild in a project folder, it tries to find the project file or a solution file in that folder. 

If you were using a tool that runs MSBuild, such as `dotnet pack`, check its documentation to ensure it is being invoked correctly. For example, if you invoke `dotnet pack` with a `.nuspec` file, which uses a different XML schema, the error references the `package` element found in those files.

If the provided file is a project file, check for any spelling or syntax errors in or near the top-level `Project` element.
