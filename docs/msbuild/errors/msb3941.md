## Description

This error occurs when your project uses the [`ZipDirectory` task](../zipdirectory-task.md), which takes an input directory and produces a compressed ZIP file, but the input directory could not be found or accessed.

## Resolution

You can use the `-v:diag` switch on the MSBuild command line to get more detailed information about the MSBuild execution, such as the values of the input parameters provided to the `ZipDirectory` task. In Visual Studio, in **Tools, Options, Build and Run**, set **Verbosity** to **Diagnostic**.

Check the spelling and syntax of the input parameters of the ZipDirectory task, which might be called from your project file (it is not called by the MSBuild, C++, or .NET SDK build system), a file that your project imports. Verify that the folder exists and allows read permissions. If your `ZipDirectory` task uses a property value or environment variable in its input, check that the property or environment variable has the expected value. If the property comes from a command line, check the command line for any syntax issues, mismatched quotes, or special shell characters.

Check that the directory allows `Read` permissions to the process that runs MSBuild.
