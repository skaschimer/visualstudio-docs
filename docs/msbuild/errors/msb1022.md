## Description

This error occurs if MSBuild was provided a response file at the MSBuild command line, but the file was not found. Response files typically have the extension `.rsp`. See [MSBuild response files](../msbuild-response-files.md).

## Resolution

Check that the response file specified in the MSBuild command line exists in the expected directory, and that the path, syntax, and spelling are correct. For paths with spaces, ensure that quotes are used to prevent the command from being misinterpreted.

If the first response file contains references to other response files, be sure to check each nested response file. Check the default response files (*MSBuild.rsp* or *Directory.Build.rsp*) that are included automatically as well, if they exist and reference other response files.

Be aware that some third-party tools invoke MSBuild using a generated response file in a temporary folder, based on the path specified in the TMP or TEMP environment variable. Refer to the documentation of the third-party tools to troubleshoot the problem.
