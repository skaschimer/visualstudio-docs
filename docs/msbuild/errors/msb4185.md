## Description

This error occurs when a [property function](../property-functions.md) is used that is not supported by MSBuild.

## Resolution

First, check for typos or misspellings in the property function mentioned in the error message.

The problem could occur if the project is using functionality that was added in a newer version of MSBuild, but you're building with an older version. Install the latest version of Visual Studio or MSBuild and try building again. See [Install Visual Studio](../../install/install-visual-studio.md) and [MSBuild - Install MSBuild](../msbuild.md#install-msbuild).
