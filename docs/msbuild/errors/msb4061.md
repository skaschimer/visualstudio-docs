## Description

This error occurs when MSBuild tries to create a task, but the task creation fails. If this occurs with a build system task, it's usually due to an installation issue. If this occurs with your own custom task, it means that something failed, perhaps in the task constructor.

## Resolution

Reinstall MSBuild or the .NET SDK, or repair your installation of Visual Studio. See [Repair Visual Studio](../../install/repair-visual-studio.md).

For your own custom tasks, you have to debug the issue. Set breakpoint in the task constructor to see if the constructor gets called, and executes successfully. Consider adding error checks or logging information in the constructor code. For more information about debugging and testing a custom task, see [Create a custom task for code generation - Generate a console app and use the custom task](../tutorial-custom-task-code-generation.md#generate-a-console-app-and-use-the-custom-task).
