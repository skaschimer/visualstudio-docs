## Description

This error occurs when you're using graph mode (`-graph` or `-graphBuild` command-line option) with the isolation option (`-isolate` or `-isolateProject` command-line option) set to `MessageUponIsolationViolation`, and, as described in the [MSBuild command-line reference](../msbuild-command-line-reference.md), there's a project that violates the isolation constraints. A project that isolates the violation constraints can still be built, but it can only be built in real time, not ahead of time and cached. Therefore the cached, serialized output of the project isn't usable. This message is not an error, but it points to an incompatibility between the specified project and the optimum function of the project isolation build mode.

## Resolution

If you can find a way to avoid the isolation constraint, perhaps by removing any build side-effects or avoiding project types that inherently violate the isolation constraints (such as XAML projects), you can avoid the situation that leads to this message.
