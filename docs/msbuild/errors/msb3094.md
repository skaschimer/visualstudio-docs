## Description

In certain operations, MSBuild tasks accept two input parameters that represent lists of items, such as sets of source and destination files for the Copy task. The logic of the task requires that the lists have the same number of items. If there's a mismatch in the number of items when they should be the same, you get this error.

## Resolution

The error message points to the items and the counts of each item. Check the items and how they're created for logic or syntax errors.
