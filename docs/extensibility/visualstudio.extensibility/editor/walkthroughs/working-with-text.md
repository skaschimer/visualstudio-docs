# Work with text in the editor

You can configure your extension code to run in response to various entry points (situations that occur when a user interacts with Visual Studio). Editor extensibility currently supports three entry points: listeners, the [EditorExtensibility](#access-editor-functionality) service object, and commands.

Event listeners are triggered when certain actions occur in an editor window, which `TextView` represents in code. For example, when a user types something into the editor, a `TextViewChanged` event occurs. When an editor window is opened or closed, `TextViewOpened` and `TextViewClosed` events occur.

The editor service object is an instance of the [`EditorExtensibility`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.editorextensibility) class, which exposes real-time editor functionality, such as performing text edits.

Users initiate [commands](../../command/command.md) by selecting an item, which you can place on a menu, context menu, or toolbar.

## Add a text view listener

There are two types of listeners, [ITextViewChangedListener](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewchangedlistener) and [ITextViewOpenClosedListener](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewopenclosedlistener).
Together, you can use these listeners to observe the opening, closing, and modification of text editors.

Then, you can create a new class. Implement the [ExtensionPart](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.extensionpart) base class and `ITextViewChangedListener`,
`ITextViewOpenClosedListener`, or both, and add a [VisualStudioContribution](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.visualstudiocontributionattribute) attribute.

You can implement the [TextViewExtensionConfiguration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.textviewextensionconfiguration) property, as required by [ITextViewChangedListener](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewchangedlistener) and [ITextViewOpenClosedListener](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewopenclosedlistener), to make the listener apply when you edit C# files:

```csharp
public TextViewExtensionConfiguration TextViewExtensionConfiguration => new()
{
    AppliesTo = new[] { DocumentFilter.FromDocumentType("CSharp") },
};
```

The available document types for other programming languages and file types are listed [later in this article](#specify-programming-languages-with-the-appliesto-configuration). Custom file types might also be defined when required.

Assuming that you decide to implement both listeners, the finished class declaration should look like the following example:

```csharp
  [VisualStudioContribution]                
  public sealed class TextViewOperationListener :
      ExtensionPart, // This is the extension part base class containing infrastructure necessary to use VS services.
      ITextViewOpenClosedListener, // Indicates this part listens for text view lifetime events.
      ITextViewChangedListener // Indicates this part listens to text view changes.
  {
      public TextViewExtensionConfiguration TextViewExtensionConfiguration => new()
      {
          // Indicates this part should only light up in C# files.
          AppliesTo = new[] { DocumentFilter.FromDocumentType("CSharp") },
      };
      ...
```

Because both [ITextViewOpenClosedListener](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewopenclosedlistener) and [ITextViewChangedListener](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewchangedlistener) declare the [TextViewExtensionConfiguration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.textviewextensionconfiguration) property, the configuration applies to both listeners.

When you run your extension, you should see:

- [ITextViewOpenClosedListener.TextViewOpenedAsync](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewopenclosedlistener.textviewopenedasync) called any time that a user opens a text view.
- [ITextViewOpenClosedListener.TextViewClosedAsync](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewopenclosedlistener.textviewclosedasync) called any time that a user closes a text view.
- [ITextViewChangedListener.TextViewChangedAsync](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewchangedlistener.textviewchangedasync) called any time that a user makes a text change to a text document that a text view displays.

Each of these methods is passed an [ITextViewSnapshot](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewsnapshot) class that contains the state of the text view and text document at the time that the user invoked the action and a `CancellationToken` that has `IsCancellationRequested == true` when the integrated development environment (IDE) wants to cancel a pending action.

## Define when your extension is relevant

Your extension is typically relevant only to certain supported document types and scenarios, so it's important to clearly define its applicability. You can use the [AppliesTo configuration](#specify-programming-languages-with-the-appliesto-configuration) in several ways to clearly define the applicability of an extension. You can specify what file types the extension supports, such as code languages. You can also further refine the applicability of an extension by matching on a pattern based on the filename or path.

### Specify programming languages with the AppliesTo configuration

The [AppliesTo](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.textviewextensionconfiguration.appliesto) configuration indicates the programming language scenarios in which the extension should activate. The configuration is written as `AppliesTo = new[] { DocumentFilter.FromDocumentType("CSharp") }`. The document type is a well-known name of a language that's built into Visual Studio or is custom defined in a Visual Studio extension.

Some well-known document types are shown in the following table.

| Document type | Description |
| - | - |
| `CSharp` | C# |
| `C/C++` | C, C++, headers, and interactive data language |
| `TypeScript` | TypeScript and JavaScript type languages |
| `HTML` | HTML |
| `JSON` | JSON |
| `text` | Text files, including hierarchical descendants of `code`, which descends from `text` |
| `code` | C, C++, C#, and so on |

Document types are hierarchical. That is, C# and C++ both descend from `code`, so declaring `code` causes your extension to activate for all code languages, such as C#, C, and C++.

### Define a new document type

You can define a new document type, for example, to support a custom code language, by adding a static [DocumentTypeConfiguration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.documenttypeconfiguration) property to any class in the extension project. Then mark the property with the [`VisualStudioContribution`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.visualstudiocontributionattribute) attribute.

You can use `DocumentTypeConfiguration` to define a new document type, specify that it inherits one or more other document types, and specify one or more file extensions that are used to identify the file type.

```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.Editor;

internal static class MyDocumentTypes
{
    [VisualStudioContribution]
    internal static DocumentTypeConfiguration MarkdownDocumentType => new("markdown")
    {
        FileExtensions = new[] { ".md", ".mdk", ".markdown" },
        BaseDocumentType = DocumentType.KnownValues.Text,
    };
}
```

Document type definitions are merged with content type definitions provided by legacy Visual Studio extensibility. You can use them to map other file extensions to existing document types.

### Document selectors

In addition to [DocumentFilter.FromDocumentType](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.documentfilter.fromdocumenttype), you can use [DocumentFilter.FromGlobPattern](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.documentfilter.fromglobpattern) to further limit applicability of the extension by making it activate only when the document's file path matches a glob (wildcard) pattern:

```csharp
[VisualStudioContribution]                
public sealed class TextViewOperationListener
    : ExtensionPart, ITextViewOpenClosedListener, ITextViewChangedListener
{
    public TextViewExtensionConfiguration TextViewExtensionConfiguration => new()
    {
        AppliesTo = new[]
        {
            DocumentFilter.FromDocumentType("CSharp"),
            DocumentFilter.FromGlobPattern("**/tests/*.cs"),
        },
    };
```

```csharp
[VisualStudioContribution]                
public sealed class TextViewOperationListener
    : ExtensionPart, ITextViewOpenClosedListener, ITextViewChangedListener
{
    public TextViewExtensionConfiguration TextViewExtensionConfiguration => new()
    {
        AppliesTo = new[]
        {
            DocumentFilter.FromDocumentType(MyDocumentTypes.MarkdownDocumentType),
            DocumentFilter.FromGlobPattern("docs/*.md", relativePath: true),
        },
    };
```

The pattern represents a glob pattern that's matched on the absolute path of the document.

Glob patterns can have the following syntax:

- `*` to match zero or more characters in a path segment.
- `?` to match one character in a path segment.
- `**` to match any number of path segments, including none.
- `{}` to group conditions. (For example, `**â€‹/*.{ts,js}` matches all TypeScript and JavaScript files.)
- `[]` to declare a range of characters to match in a path segment (for example, `example.[0-9]` to match `example.0`, `example.1`, and so on).
- `[!...]` to negate a range of characters to match in a path segment (for example, `example.[!0-9]` to match `example.a` and `example.b` but not `example.0`).

A backslash (`\`) isn't valid within a glob pattern. Make sure to convert any backslash to a forward slash (`/`) when you create the glob pattern.

## Access editor functionality

Your editor extension classes inherit from [ExtensionPart](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.extensionpart). The `ExtensionPart` class exposes the [Extensibility](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.extensionpart.extensibility) property. By using this property, you can request an instance of the [EditorExtensibility](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.editorextensibility) object. You can use this object to access real-time editor functionality, such as performing edits.

```csharp
EditorExtensibility editorService = this.Extensibility.Editor();
```

### Access editor state within a command

The `ExecuteCommandAsync()` method in each `Command` is passed `IClientContext` that contains a snapshot of the state of the IDE at the time the command was invoked. You can access the active document via the [`ITextViewSnapshot`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewsnapshot) interface, which you get from the [`EditorExtensibility`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.editorextensibility) object by calling the asynchronous method [`GetActiveTextViewAsync`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.editorextensibility.getactivetextviewasync).

```csharp
using ITextViewSnapshot textView = await this.Extensibility.Editor().GetActiveTextViewAsync(clientContext, cancellationToken);
```

When you have the `ITextViewSnapshot` class, you can access the editor state. The [`ITextViewSnapshot`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.extensibility.editor.itextviewsnapshot) class is an immutable view of the editor state at a point in time, so you need to use the other interfaces in the [Editor object model](./../editor-concepts.md) to make edits.
